# "Monster's Shift"

## High-Level Concept
**Genre**:
* Town Life Sim x Horror

**Setting**: 
* A cute small-town, the childhood home of the protagonist, whose inhabitants turn into random themed monsters during the night.
	* (don’t forget about the chopped babies)

**Inspiration Sources**:
* Stardew Valley (RPG life-sim, farming mechanics)
* Spiritfarer (relationship-building, unfolding narrative)
* OMORI (part-time jobs during the day)
* Lethal Company (horror elements, survival strategies)


## Gameplay
### Day/Night Cycle
#### Daytime
* Do part-time jobs to keep reputation high and residents happy
* As time progresses, jobs get more difficult and/or you have increasingly less time to finish all the part-time jobs available to you.
* Spend money on cosmetics, upgrades
* Town
	* Doing optional daily tasks with townsfolk — (e.g. errands for grandma, pizza deliveries, diner dash, amongus tasks)
	* Interacting with townsfolk
#### Nighttime:
* Investigate lore of the town
* Defend/avoid residents turned monsters

## Narrative
* Plot Progression:
	* Night-time investigations (town, cave)
		1. Notebooks/pages full of LOOOOOOOOORE
		2. Non-linear storytelling?
	OR
	* Home defense against supernatural threats
		1. Villagers have “tells” that hint at the monster they become at night, linking survival strategies with their daytime knowledge of townsfolk.
	OR
	* Investigating non-supernatural anomalies with townsfolk
		1. Investigating [piles of bones, chopped baby remains, suspicious deliveries, creepy dialogues, blood splatters, gooey bits?]

## Art and Visuals
* Harvest Island
* Elderfield
* OMORI

## Core Systems
1. Gameplay Loop
	* Multi-week day/night cycle progression where each day offers minigames and each night reveals new story layers and increases difficulty.
	* Story progression driven by exploration, information gathering, and interaction with townsfolk.
2. Villager Interactions
	* Unique villager designs
	* Part-time jobs/Errands
3. Exploration and Clue Gathering
4. Dealing with monsters
	Combat?
	Avoiding?

## Current Gaps and Open Questions
1. Scope Definition:
	* 2D, with potential for 2.5 or sidescrolling interiors
2. Narrative Integration:
	* Clarify how knowledge is obtained or narrative is dispensed
3. Art and Animation:
	* Visual style and required assets, taking time required into consideration ensuring we have time to create animations, especially for transformations and spooky effects.
4. Testing and Iterations
