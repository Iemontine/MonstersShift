# "Untitled Spooky Farm Sim Game"

## High-Level Concept
* Genre: Horror with a [Farming/Minigame/Roguelike/Survival] twist
* Setting: Cute small-town life with disturbing, horror-laden secrets. A quaint rural town where the player is a newcomer trying to survive and thrive, only to discover that sinister secrets lurk behind the wholesome facade.

* Inspiration Sources:
	* Stardew Valley (RPG life-sim, farming mechanics)
	* Spiritfarer (relationship-building, unfolding narrative)
	* Lethal Company (quick-action horror elements, survival strategies)

## Gameplay
### Day/Night Cycle:
#### Daytime (the calm):
* **Farm/base management**
	* Invest resources earned to protect and improve the farm
	* Purchase “cosmetic” upgrades, clothes, furniture
* **Town**
	* Doing optional daily tasks with townsfolk — running small/odd jobs (e.g. deliveries, diner dash)
	* Interacting with townsfolk
#### Nighttime (the storm):
* Descending into a nearby cave, Lethal Company-esque gameplay ensues

	OR
* Home defense against supernatural threats

	OR
* Investigating non-supernatural anomalies with townsfolk
	* Baby choppers
	* Cult

## Narrative
### Plot Progression:
* Descending into a nearby cave, Lethal Company-esque gameplay ensues
	* Notebooks/pages found in the cave

	OR
* Home defense against supernatural threats
	* Villagers have “tells” that hint at the monster they become at night, linking survival strategies with their daytime knowledge of townsfolk.
	
	OR
* Investigating non-supernatural anomalies with townsfolk

2. **Exploration and Clue Gathering**

## Current Gaps and Open Questions
1. Scope Definition:
	* Define exact scope to fit a 5-week timeline—clarify which aspects of the farm and town interactions to include or cut.
	* Team size
	* Missing skill sets or roles
	* 2D or 2.5D or 3D?
2. Narrative Integration:
	* Clarify how knowledge is obtained or narrative is dispensed
3. Art and Animation:
	* Visual style and required assets, taking time required into consideration ensuring we have time to create animations, especially for transformations and spooky effects.
4. Testing and Iterations

## Timeline
1. Week 1 - Define core mechanics, set up GitHub, and finalize project scope.
