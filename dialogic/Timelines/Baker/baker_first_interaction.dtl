baker: Hey there sugar! You new to town? I think I’d recognize a face like yours if I’d seen it before!
player: I actually just moved into this place my brother left me. Did you know him? His name was Benjamin.
baker: Benjamin…hm…oh! You mean my old pal Benny? He was the best! He would always come help out.
baker: Without him here, I’ve been so behind! The stress is making me very hungry…
