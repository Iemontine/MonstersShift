# Occurs right before chase scene
# Zombie grumbling
[sound volume="0.0"]
You hear a weird grumbling noise coming from the baker. He turns towards you - his face is sunken in and eyes bright red.
baker: Uuuuuu…ugh….I am feeling hungry…hungry for your brains!
player: What! He’s a zombie? I have to run!!
In a panic, you grab the baking equipment. Hopefully, it’ll be useful.
